    <h3>Chicken Tacos</h3>

    <p>
    This is one of my family's go-to recipes. With few ingredients, 
    its easy to make this in a hurry in the instant pot, or let sit through
    the day in the crockpot. It could be a keto friendly bowl, tacos, burritos, 
    empanadas, heck we have added canned veggies and turned it into a taco soup!
    The versatility makes this a staple base to any household.
