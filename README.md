# odin-recipes
"Set up your ~README.MD~ file and write a brief introduction describing:
	-Current Project
	-Skills you will have demonstrated upon completion
NOTE: do this before and after, compare, and review. 

-the current project is creating a recipe "website" through TOP>Foundations>Project:Recipes

-Hopefully, afterwards, I will understand more about how to move and mess with Git and Git hub. 
Also, excited to learn some more codes to make the site look better. :3
